👋 Hi, I'm Liam Alsopp, a passionate programmer and data engineer on a mission to create innovative solutions through technology! With a strong background in space exploration systems and astrophysics, I'm always eager to apply my problem-solving skills to tackle complex challenges and push the boundaries of what's possible.

🌐 My expertise spans various programming languages and technologies, including Python, Linux, JavaScript, and web development. I have a proven track record in data analysis, software development, and system administration, making me well-equipped to contribute to a wide range of projects.

🚀 As an active member of the GitHub community, I love collaborating with other developers and sharing my knowledge to help others grow. You'll find repositories here that showcase my personal projects, contributions to open source initiatives, and educational resources to empower fellow programmers.

🌟 When I'm not coding or exploring the latest tech trends, I enjoy stargazing, reading about space exploration, and experimenting in the kitchen with new recipes.

💼 If you'd like to connect, collaborate, or discuss potential projects, please don't hesitate to reach out through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liamalsopp/) or [email](mailto:liam.alsopp@otterbyte.co.uk).
